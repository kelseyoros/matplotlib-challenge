# matplotlib-challenge

Pymaceuticals Inc. is a fictional burgeoning pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medication. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.  Currently, the drug of interest is Capomulin.

Pymaceuticals Inc. just compiled data from their most recent 45-day animal study where 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Tumor development was observed and measured throughout the study.  With this information, I generated all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. I also provided a summary of the study results.
